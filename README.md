# BetterMegascan
Simple addon to help you import Megascans into your Blender scenes with a lot of customizations without having Bridge installed.

Be sure file any bug reports and feature requests!

Addon is now somewhat of a preview because I'm not sure if anyone finds it useful.

## Features
Allows import of:
  - 3D Assets (plants)
  - Surfaces (decals, atlases, ...)
  - Brushes (their opacity maps)
  - Custom naming templates

The import process is highly customizable (i'm too lazy to update the image - there is more now):
